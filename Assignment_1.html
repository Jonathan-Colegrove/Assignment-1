    <p>The web has undergone many different changes, from essentially text on a black screen to animated, interactive, colorful designs customizable for a variety of devices.  Websites started as a convenient, quick way to exchange information or ideas.  Things worked, but if things can be improved, why not?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="columns">
    <p>Over the ensuing years, people wanted to mix pictures with their text, and align things in eye-catching ways.  A picture is worth a thousand words, right?  Enter: Tables.  Tables allowed for a grid-like system of distributing things inside a webpage.  The format was easier to control, as tables allowed the ability to calculate things in percentages, etc.  This still wasnâ€™t perfect, however, as websites still lacked immediate interaction with the viewer.  JavaScript was the solution, and everything from helpful to annoying popups came into being.</p>
    <p>Next came Flash, which added a new dimension to websites, allowing for easier work with animations and other design features.  CSS was also developed, which helped developers keep track of things by separating the material from the styling.  The next hurdle designers and developers had to overcome was to present a webpage on a mobile device.  Limited internet amounts and smaller screen size posed problems, which were solved by restructuring the website material and simplifying the layout (creating a new layout) for mobile devices.</p></div>
    <p>Multiple companies creating products makes things complicated for developers, so the future is aimed at making websites show up the same.  This is accomplished by making new units to code with.  Some of the units will control multiple things, which will allow faster results when trying to change code.</p></div>
    <p>I am excited with where developing is headed.  Many problems have been addressed over the years, and many improvements have helped make websites a more important and useful part of everyday life.  The future will build on the past work, helping make life more enjoyable and easier.</p>
